# ADR-0002: Rule-Based Adjudication and False-Positive Remediation

Date: 2026-10-13
Status: Accepted (v1 remediation validated by re-measurement; live-loop
control run 2026-10-13; context-pack measurement N=3 recorded 2026-10-13)

Supersedes the adjudication portions of ADR-0001.

## Context

On its first real workload — a 300-line QtTune bridge refactor — the
tribunal's reviewer produced 12 blockers, of which post-hoc triage against
actual source confirmed exactly 1 real defect: precision 1/12 (~8%),
despite 0/5 false positives on the clean-header fixture probe.

The fixture-vs-production gap is the central eval finding of this project:
synthetic-fixture success did not transfer to real workloads.

## Blocker Triage (original run, 2026-10-07)

| Class | Count | Examples | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Layer-rule misapplication | 7 | Qt-header includes in qttunebridge.h/.cpp | FP: bridge is app-layer; CMake FATAL_ERRORs on Qt in qttune-core |
| Definition-context guessing | 3 | "frame->data may reference freed stack memory"; anon-struct ABI worry | FP: qttune_frame_t has inline uint8_t data[64] — struct copy IS a deep copy; anon typedef is legal C |
| Pedantic over-promotion | 1 | m_lastReportedDropped non-atomic | FP: GUI-thread-only mirror paired with atomic counter is the correct pattern |
| Real defect | 1 | qttune_decode_signal(..., 8, ...) ignores frame->data_length | Confirmed — latent under mock transport (always 8 bytes), breaks for CAN-FD. Fixed in QtTune. |

Missed by the review (found by source-level triage): dropped-frame
report starvation under saturation; last-write-wins in the staging
buffer coalescing path. Diff-only review without full-repo context has
a blind spot that cuts both ways.

**Key diagnostic:** in round 2, the reviewer asked "What is the exact
structure of qttune_frame_t?" in its questions channel while filing a
stack-memory-use blocker. The model's epistemic state was correct —
uncertain — but the taxonomy discipline failed: hedged speculation was
promoted to a demonstrable-violation claim.

## Decision

Adjudication is implemented as deterministic guardrails over model
output, not prompt pleas. Failure classes are remediated per-class with
the narrowest mechanism that addresses the root cause:

1. **Hedge demotion** (class: speculative phrasing) — blockers whose
   text contains hedge language ("may", "might", "could", "appears to")
   are demoted to questions before judging. Regex guardrail
   (adjudication.demote_hedged_blockers), regression-tested against
   production-derived blocker texts — runnable with no LLM.

   Deliberate boundary: catches phrased-as-speculation only.
   Confidently stated assertions — including wrong ones — pass through.
   Verified experimentally: a reviewer confidently flagging a race
   condition documented in the code's own comment was correctly NOT
   demoted.

2. **Layer metadata injection** (class: layer misapplication) —
   file_metadata.py maps paths to QtTune layers (core/bridge/app);
   the transcript states which rules apply, pre-legitimizing
   bridge-layer Qt includes.

3. **Definition-context injection** (class: information deficit) —
   planned (v2). Inject struct definitions and repo-level context
   as ground truth. Not a filtering problem: no regex can fix a model
   confidently asserting facts it cannot see.

Design principles, in priority order: fail closed on unusable input;
derive verdicts from content arrays, never self-reported labels;
separate what the model KNOWS (questions channel) from what it CLAIMS
(blockers channel); measure, remediate, re-measure.

## Re-Measurement After v1 (2026-10-09)

Same diff, same models, same prompt version. Prediction recorded
before running: Qt-leakage gone, hedged stack-memory claims demoted,
hardcoded-8 catch retained.

| Class | Baseline | v1 Re-run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Layer-rule misapplication | 7 | 0 | Eliminated |
| Hedge-speculation | 3 | 0 | Eliminated — notably, 0 demotions fired: the reviewer stopped hedging (taxonomy discipline at the source), the guardrail never triggered |
| Definition-context guessing | 3 | 1 | Persists — expected, not yet remediated |
| Confident-but-wrong assertions | 0 | 4 | NEW dominant class: thread-safety claims on m_currentFrameCount, which is GUI-thread-only by queued-connection construction |
| Real defect | 1 | 1 | Retained (hardcoded 8-byte buffer) |

Precision: 1/12 (~8%) → 1/6 (~17%). Blocker volume halved (12 → 6).

## Consequences

- The v1 remediations eliminated their target classes outright.
  What remains is almost entirely the information-deficit class:
  confident assertions from missing context. Hedge regex provably
  cannot address it; definition-context injection (v2) is the
  designated remedy. Prediction: the 4 thread-safety false positives
  require seeing the queued-connection call sites, which retrieval-
  based context injection can supply.
- An honest tension to keep visible: as FP rate drops, the reviewer's
  blockers become fewer and higher-precision — but single-run results
  remain anecdotes. The 1/12 → 1/6 delta is one run vs. one run;
  the class-level eliminations (7/7 and 3/3) are the stronger evidence.
- Cross-cutting limits identified: the reviewer still missed both
  real bugs found only by full-repo triage (drop-count starvation,
  staging-buffer last-write-wins). The diff-centric workflow itself
  caps recall, independent of precision. This motivates the repo
  context-pack work (see STATUS.md backlog).
- Golden suite now 10/10 (3 model fixtures + 7 deterministic guardrail
  units, production-derived texts). The deterministic subset is
  CI-suitable with no model serving.
  
  ## Erratum (2026-10-09)

Two defects found by external review (2026-10-09):

1. **Debate feedback loop was not wired.** `transcript_base` was frozen
   before the loop; the REVISE ADDRESSING feedback accumulated in the
   proposal variable but was never re-rendered into agent transcripts.
   Consequence: archived "3-round debates" were one exploratory sample
   (round 1) plus two constrained resamples — not adversarial
   iteration. Impact on recorded results: none on validity of the
   precision measurements (baseline and v1 re-measurement ran the same
   code, so they are internally consistent multi-sample comparisons;
   class-level eliminations stand), but records should be read as
   sampling measurements, not convergent debates. Fixed 2026-10-09:
   transcript re-rendered per round; PROMPT_VERSION bumped.
   Attribution note for future measurements: post-fix debates differ
   from archived ones in mechanism, not just remediation — per-class
   comparison remains the method.

2. **Bake-off summary conflated clean passes with bug hits** (second
   occurrence; prior fix never committed). ADR numbers unaffected —
   5/5 was read from individual result lines. Summary printer fixed;
   tp + fn invariant documented inline.
   
## Intermediate Measurement (2026-10-13) — Live Feedback Loop, No Context Injection

Not the context-pack measurement (that remains queued): this run
isolates a different variable. The 2026-10-09 records ran with the
dead feedback loop; this is the first run of the same diff and
proposal on the live loop (plus the 2026-10-10 hardening pass).

Prediction recorded before running: round 1 reproduces ~v1 volume
(5–7 blockers, 4 thread-safety FPs, decode defect retained), rounds
2–3 diverge, no agent failures, verdict MAX_ROUNDS_EXCEEDED.

Result: prediction MISSED on volume and placement.

| Class | v1 Re-run (014257) | Live loop (170208) |
|---|---|---|
| Round-1 blockers | 6 | 1 (m_currentFrameCount data race — confident-but-wrong) |
| Confident-but-wrong FPs | 4 | 1 (same m_currentFrameCount claim, consolidated) |
| Layer-rule FPs | 0 | 0 |
| Hedge demotions | 0 | 0 |
| decode_signal 8-byte defect | Caught as blocker | Raised as a ROUND-2 NIT ("verify data_length <= 8") |
| Verdict | MAX_ROUNDS_EXCEEDED | MAX_ROUNDS_EXCEEDED |

Round-1 precision: 0/1. Across all rounds: 0/5. Real defect visible
in-channel but mis-classified as an optional improvement.

Findings:

- Round-2/3 dynamics: the reviewer refined citations (splitting,
  then simplifying the race claim) rather than amplifying; the
  engineer held "approve" throughout. Feedback reached both agents
  (evidence: round-2 content responds to round-1 engineer concerns).
- Three stacked deltas make attribution impossible from one run:
  live loop, hardening (schema validation, layer note now "bridge"
  — v1 also had that), and model run-to-run variance. Laguna-xs-2.1
  is nondeterministic at temp 0.7; a 6→1 blocker drop is within
  plausible single-sample variance for this model.
- Defect drifting blocker→nit is a new failure mode worth watching:
  precision metrics that only count blockers will miss a defect the
  reviewer technically surfaced. Future measurements should scan all
  channels for known-defect mentions.

Record: `coach_artifacts/decision_debate_20261013_170208_71915a.json`,
fixture `docs/fixtures/qttune_bridge_refactor.diff` (hash f031d33a).

Implication: single-run blocker counts from this model cannot be
treated as stable measurements at current settings. The context-pack
measurement should run multiple times (or score a multi-run aggregate)
before claiming FP-class collapse.

## Fourth Measurement (Pending) — Context Pack Injection

**Design:** Same diff (`qttune_bridge_refactor.diff`), same proposal text,
same models (laguna-xs-2.1 + gemma4:12b), PROMPT_VERSION v5-context-pack,
**context pack now injected** (retrieved purposes, types, constants,
queued-connection call sites). N=3 runs, round-1 only, per-class
attribution. Control arms: v1 blind resample (014257), live-loop control
(170208).

**Indexed ground truth confirmed:** `app/qttunebridge.cpp` contains two
queued-connection call sites, both carrying `Qt::QueuedConnection`:
- Line 390: `invokeMethod(self, [...], Qt::QueuedConnection)` invoking
  `handleFrameInternal` — the receiver of m_currentFrameCount access
  flagged in the 170208 run as a "data race."

**Prediction (per-class rates, N=3):**

| Class | v1 (014257) | Live-loop control (170208) | Predicted (v5, N=3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thread-safety FPs (queued-conn class) | 4 | 1 | 0–2 (median 1) |
| Real defect (decode_signal 8-byte) | 1 (blocker) | 0 (drifted to nit) | 0–1 |
| Layer-rule FPs | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Hedge FPs | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Deletion-consistency FPs (new class) | 0 | 0 | 0–4 (emerging; pilot suggested 3) |

**Rationale for range, not point estimate:** the live-loop control
showed single-run variance of 6→1 blockers on near-identical inputs
(without retrieval). Even if retrieval supplies the queued-connection
ground truth that refutes the m_currentFrameCount claim, laguna-xs-2.1
at temp 0.7 may or may not draw on it within a single run. Three runs
estimate the per-class rate; median of 1 FP acknowledges variance while
predicting collapse of the *majority* of the 4-v1 FP class.

**Failure mode to watch:** decoder defect drifts blocker→question/nit
(as in 170208 round 2). Future precision metrics must scan all channels,
not just blockers.

**Confound noted:** index from current QtTune tree (40 files, j2534
changes added) while diff is older snapshot. Arguably realistic (reviews
run against current trees); if the 4 new files introduce new identifiers
the retrieval pulls, that's noise in the context but not bias in the
comparison (both arms measure retrieval's practical value).

**Record:** decision_record_[id].json for each run, `repo_context.json`
with callsites (idx_20261013_*).

## Results (2026-10-13, N=3)

Runs: `decision_debate_20261013_203802_276bd0` (run 1),
`decision_debate_20261013_204845_e4d1b3` (run 2),
`decision_debate_20261013_210548_6ce6c0` (run 3). Retrieval was
identical in all three runs (pack 1983/6000 chars, 14 entries, 2
queued-connection call sites, `error: null`) — deterministic across
runs. A pilot run (`ff958c`, wiring validation only) is committed as
unscored evidence and is excluded from these numbers.

| Class | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Total | Prediction | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Round-1 blockers | 3 | 6 | 1 | 10 | — | — |
| Thread-safety FPs | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0–2 | **HIT — class collapsed, 3/3 runs** |
| Deletion-consistency FPs | 2 | 6 | 0 | 8 | 0–4 | **MISSED HIGH** |
| True positives | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | — | Best catches in project history |
| Hedge demotions | 0 | 0 | 1 | — | — | First firing since remediation |

Round-1 precision: **2/10 (20%)**; run-level 1/3, 0/6, 1/1. Run 2
ended `AGENT_FAILURE` at round 2 (num_ctx truncation); its round-1 arm
completed cleanly and is scored as pre-declared.

**True positives (both adjudicated against the diff's post-state and
QtTune real history):**

1. Run 1: the cumulative `m_currentFrameCount` gate drops every frame
   permanently after 10,000 total frames — and the diff deletes
   `StreamingContinuesPastTenThousandFrames`, the regression test
   guarding exactly this regression. Maintainer-confirmed as the
   historical freeze bug.
2. Run 3: data race on plain `int m_currentFrameCount` — read in
   `onFrame()` on the worker thread (backpressure check), written in
   `handleFrameInternal()` on the GUI thread; unsynchronized in the
   diff's post-state. The pilot additionally showed the claim
   returning as round-3 blockers after the live feedback loop carried
   the engineer's concern back to the reviewer.

**Fixture provenance (established by forensics, correcting an earlier
misreading):** the fixture is the reverse patch of merged QtTune
commit `e0c4c31`; its post-state is byte-identical to QtTune's
committed `8ffbf19` bridge state (blob `1c195f8`, verified via
`git log --all --find-object=1c195f8`). Both TPs are therefore bugs
that **actually shipped** and were later fixed in real history: the
freeze by `e0c4c31`'s in-flight gate plus the restored regression
test (documented in `d565764`), and the thread boundary by the
worker-path hardening in `b47687c`. The reviewer detected two real,
previously-shipped bugs from a diff alone.

**Negative findings (recorded, not yet remediated):**

- **Deletion-consistency class exceeded prediction** (8 total, 6/0/1
  by run — extreme variance): the reviewer fabricates surviving
  remnants of jointly removed code ("signalModel() still declared"),
  all false against the diff. Candidate remediation: ground removed
  symbols from the diff's minus side and require confirmation before
  assertion.
- **Hedge demotion fired once, on a hedged formulation of a TRUE
  thread-safety claim** (run 3, round 1). Hedged language does not
  imply incorrectness; strengthens the case for backlog #12.
- **num_ctx crowding:** the pack (~2k chars) plus feedback growth
  caused `done_reason=length` truncations in rounds 2+ (one
  AGENT_FAILURE). The retrieval budget competes with the debate
  loop's context growth; pack-from-rounds-2+ or a larger num_ctx is
  the trade space.
  *Correction (2026-10-22, code review 2026-10-21 finding 8):* the
  prompt sizes do not support this attribution. In run 2 the diff is
  26,695 of ~32,000 prompt chars (~83%); the pack is 2,023 and the
  reviewer system prompt 1,890, and the proposal grew from 66 to 1,371
  chars. Round 2's prompt was only ~4% larger than round 1's, which
  completed. Thinking-token output in a nearly full 16K window is the
  likelier driver, but no token counts were recorded, so it is
  unverified. Debates record per-attempt token telemetry from
  2026-10-22 on (STATUS backlog #4). The trade space is an output cap
  (`num_predict`) or a larger num_ctx; dropping the pack recovers
  little.

**Re-adjudication flag (retroactive):** the v1 re-measurement's
dominant residual class — thread-safety claims on
`m_currentFrameCount`, refuted as "GUI-thread-only by
queued-connection construction" — is **invalidated by the forensics
above**: in the fixture's post-state the variable IS read on the
worker thread. Some of the four v1 "confident-but-wrong" FPs and the
170208 control's single blocker are likely true positives, mislabeled
because the triage refutation was drawn from maintained QtTune rather
than the diff's post-state. Those runs warrant re-triage against
their blocker texts before their historical FP counts stand. This
measurement's numbers are unaffected — scored against the diff text.

**Interpretation:** the context pack did what it was designed to do —
eliminated the targeted information-deficit class in 3/3 runs, with
the residual concern correctly filed as questions — and enabled the
best catches in the project's history. But total FP volume did not
fall; it migrated to a new hallucination class. The tribunal now
knows what the code contains; it still cannot reliably reason about
what a diff removes. Per the standing loop, that is the next class to
remediate and re-measure.
