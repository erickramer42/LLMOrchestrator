# ADR-0002: Rule-Based Adjudication and False-Positive Remediation

Date: 2026-10-09
Status: Accepted (v1 remediation validated by re-measurement; v2 in flight)

Supersedes the adjudication portions of ADR-0001.

## Context

On its first real workload — a 300-line QtTune bridge refactor — the
tribunal's reviewer produced 12 blockers, of which post-hoc triage against
actual source confirmed exactly 1 real defect: precision 1/12 (~8%),
despite 0/5 false positives on the clean-header fixture probe.

The fixture-vs-production gap is the central eval finding of this project:
synthetic-fixture success did not transfer to real workloads.

## Blocker Triage (original run, 2026-10-07)

| Class | Count | Examples | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Layer-rule misapplication | 7 | Qt-header includes in qttunebridge.h/.cpp | FP: bridge is app-layer; CMake FATAL_ERRORs on Qt in qttune-core |
| Definition-context guessing | 3 | "frame->data may reference freed stack memory"; anon-struct ABI worry | FP: qttune_frame_t has inline uint8_t data[64] — struct copy IS a deep copy; anon typedef is legal C |
| Pedantic over-promotion | 1 | m_lastReportedDropped non-atomic | FP: GUI-thread-only mirror paired with atomic counter is the correct pattern |
| Real defect | 1 | qttune_decode_signal(..., 8, ...) ignores frame->data_length | Confirmed — latent under mock transport (always 8 bytes), breaks for CAN-FD. Fixed in QtTune. |

Missed by the review (found by source-level triage): dropped-frame
report starvation under saturation; last-write-wins in the staging
buffer coalescing path. Diff-only review without full-repo context has
a blind spot that cuts both ways.

**Key diagnostic:** in round 2, the reviewer asked "What is the exact
structure of qttune_frame_t?" in its questions channel while filing a
stack-memory-use blocker. The model's epistemic state was correct —
uncertain — but the taxonomy discipline failed: hedged speculation was
promoted to a demonstrable-violation claim.

## Decision

Adjudication is implemented as deterministic guardrails over model
output, not prompt pleas. Failure classes are remediated per-class with
the narrowest mechanism that addresses the root cause:

1. **Hedge demotion** (class: speculative phrasing) — blockers whose
   text contains hedge language ("may", "might", "could", "appears to")
   are demoted to questions before judging. Regex guardrail
   (adjudication.demote_hedged_blockers), regression-tested against
   production-derived blocker texts — runnable with no LLM.

   Deliberate boundary: catches phrased-as-speculation only.
   Confidently stated assertions — including wrong ones — pass through.
   Verified experimentally: a reviewer confidently flagging a race
   condition documented in the code's own comment was correctly NOT
   demoted.

2. **Layer metadata injection** (class: layer misapplication) —
   file_metadata.py maps paths to QtTune layers (core/bridge/app);
   the transcript states which rules apply, pre-legitimizing
   bridge-layer Qt includes.

3. **Definition-context injection** (class: information deficit) —
   planned (v2). Inject struct definitions and repo-level context
   as ground truth. Not a filtering problem: no regex can fix a model
   confidently asserting facts it cannot see.

Design principles, in priority order: fail closed on unusable input;
derive verdicts from content arrays, never self-reported labels;
separate what the model KNOWS (questions channel) from what it CLAIMS
(blockers channel); measure, remediate, re-measure.

## Re-Measurement After v1 (2026-10-09)

Same diff, same models, same prompt version. Prediction recorded
before running: Qt-leakage gone, hedged stack-memory claims demoted,
hardcoded-8 catch retained.

| Class | Baseline | v1 Re-run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Layer-rule misapplication | 7 | 0 | Eliminated |
| Hedge-speculation | 3 | 0 | Eliminated — notably, 0 demotions fired: the reviewer stopped hedging (taxonomy discipline at the source), the guardrail never triggered |
| Definition-context guessing | 3 | 1 | Persists — expected, not yet remediated |
| Confident-but-wrong assertions | 0 | 4 | NEW dominant class: thread-safety claims on m_currentFrameCount, which is GUI-thread-only by queued-connection construction |
| Real defect | 1 | 1 | Retained (hardcoded 8-byte buffer) |

Precision: 1/12 (~8%) → 1/6 (~17%). Blocker volume halved (12 → 6).

## Consequences

- The v1 remediations eliminated their target classes outright.
  What remains is almost entirely the information-deficit class:
  confident assertions from missing context. Hedge regex provably
  cannot address it; definition-context injection (v2) is the
  designated remedy. Prediction: the 4 thread-safety false positives
  require seeing the queued-connection call sites, which retrieval-
  based context injection can supply.
- An honest tension to keep visible: as FP rate drops, the reviewer's
  blockers become fewer and higher-precision — but single-run results
  remain anecdotes. The 1/12 → 1/6 delta is one run vs. one run;
  the class-level eliminations (7/7 and 3/3) are the stronger evidence.
- Cross-cutting limits identified: the reviewer still missed both
  real bugs found only by full-repo triage (drop-count starvation,
  staging-buffer last-write-wins). The diff-centric workflow itself
  caps recall, independent of precision. This motivates the repo
  context-pack work (see STATUS.md backlog).
- Golden suite now 10/10 (3 model fixtures + 7 deterministic guardrail
  units, production-derived texts). The deterministic subset is
  CI-suitable with no model serving.
